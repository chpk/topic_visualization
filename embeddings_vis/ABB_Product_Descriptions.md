EC Titanium™, V*S Master and RPMAC motors

EC Titanium™, V*S Master and RPMAC motors exceed all requirements of NEMA MG-1 Parts 30 and 31 for AC induction motors powered from adjustable speed inverter control. Satisfactory motor performance depends on proper drive setup.
Super-E® motors: Super-E motors are inverter-ready and meet NEMA MG 1 Part 31.4.4.2. Super-E motors are suitable for use with inverter drives. Motor inverter setup is unique to each specific application. Proper setup and wiring procedures must be closely followed.
Application considerations: It is necessary that motor-drive applications are commissioned by persons familiar with the operation and setup of adjustable speed drives, applicable electrical codes and any other regulations.
Each drive must be tuned to the motor for the specific application. System operating parameters must be checked, including voltage at motor power leads, to insure that motor/drive setup has been successfully completed.
Applications that are not properly setup can lead to substandard performance and failure of system components. In some installations, shaft grounding and isolated bearings may prevent bearing fluting and are available as an option or through Mod Express®.
Reference the chart below for constant torque and variable torque capabilities for each product family. Torque performance depends upon proper drive setup.
Motors 48 body style and smaller are suitable for maximum 230V inverter operation.
Efficiency savings: Significant energy savings can be achieved when applying inverter-ready motors such as the Baldor-Reliance® Super-E to centrifugal load applications (fan and centrifugal pump) and running at reduced speed taking advantage of the affinity laws where motor load and corresponding energy consumption is reduced by the cube of the speed.
